Neural POS Tagging
This Python code demonstrates the implementation FFNN and RNN POS Tagging.

For Feed forward neural network, please open the FFNN_.ipynb file.The Graphs and accuracies are present there.
There is one example provided as well to conduct POS experiments


For Recurrent Neural network, please open the RNN_.ipynb file. The Graphs and accuracies are present there.
There is one example provided as well to conduct POS experiments.

Usage
Prerequisites: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
Dependencies: Install required modules
Modify the script as needed for your analysis.


# Both the feedforward neural network (FFNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN) models are stored in separate files; they have not been consolidated into a single file.
